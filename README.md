> [!TIP]
> I Suggest Creating A Function That Caps Framerates To Either The Client's Monitor Refresh Rate Or Just a Hard Cap At 144fps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Download ImGui: [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git)
> - Replace The "main.cpp" Code With My "main.cpp" Code In The Direct X9 Example

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Vsync Causes The Application To Run With High Delays And Low Framerates, So I Have Disabled It For Now.
> I Also Enabled Unlimited Fps To Combat The Low Frames.
