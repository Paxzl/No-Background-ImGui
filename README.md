Download ImGui = https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git, Replace The "main.Cpp" Code With My "main.Cpp" Code In The Direct X9 Example.

Vsync Causes The Appliction To Run With High Delays And Low Framerates, So I Have Disabled It For Now. I Also Enabled Unlimited Fps To Combat The Low Frames, But I Suggest Creating A Fuction To Cap It To Either Clients Mointor Refresh Rate Or Just Hard Cap At 144fps.
